# Active Directory Computers

## Overview

**Computers** in Active Directory (AD) are objects that represent physical computer entities within a network. These accounts are essential for authenticating computers to the domain and managing their access to network resources. Computer accounts enable secure integration of devices into the AD environment, facilitating centralized management, security policy enforcement, and auditing of device interactions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Authentication**: Computer accounts allow devices to authenticate to the domain using protocols like Kerberos or NTLM, ensuring secure communication with domain controllers and other resources.
- **Unique Identity**: Each computer account has a unique Security Identifier (SID) within the domain, distinguishing it from other objects and enabling precise access control.
- **Attributes**: Computer objects store attributes such as the computer name, operating system version, location, and group memberships, which can be used for inventory and management purposes.
- **Domain Membership**: Computers must join a domain to participate in AD, creating a computer account in the process. This membership allows the application of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and other domain policies.

## Types of Computer Accounts

- **Workstation Accounts**: Represent end-user devices such as desktops and laptops used by individuals within the organization.
- **Server Accounts**: Represent servers hosting services or applications, often requiring specific permissions and policies tailored to their roles.
- **Domain Controller Accounts**: Special computer accounts for domain controllers, which host the AD database and provide authentication services. These accounts are critical and have unique security considerations.

## Management and Organization

- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Computer accounts are often organized into OUs for administrative purposes. OUs enable the application of GPOs to specific sets of computers, such as enforcing security settings or software deployment.
- **Group Memberships**: Computers can be members of security groups to manage access to resources. Assigning permissions through groups simplifies administration, especially for servers requiring access to specific network shares or services.

## Operational Importance

- **Centralized Management**: Computer accounts allow administrators to manage devices centrally through AD tools like Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), applying policies, updates, and configurations uniformly.
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Through GPOs linked to OUs containing computer accounts, administrators can enforce security settings such as password policies, firewall rules, and software restrictions.
- **Auditing and Compliance**: Computer accounts facilitate tracking and auditing of device access to resources, aiding in compliance with organizational and regulatory security standards.
- **Resource Access**: Authenticated computer accounts enable devices to access domain resources like file shares, printers, and applications, ensuring only trusted devices interact with sensitive data.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Management**: Computer accounts have passwords that are automatically managed and rotated by AD (every 30 days by default). Disabling or manually changing these passwords can disrupt authentication, so it should be avoided unless necessary.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure computer accounts, especially for servers, have only the necessary permissions to perform their functions, minimizing the risk of misuse if compromised.
- **Secure Domain Join**: Use secure methods for joining computers to the domain, requiring appropriate administrative credentials and ensuring devices are trusted.
- **Regular Auditing**: Monitor computer account activity for signs of unauthorized access or anomalies, such as unexpected logins or changes to account properties.
- **Disable Unused Accounts**: Disable computer accounts for devices no longer in use rather than deleting them, preserving historical data while reducing security risks.
- **Protect Domain Controllers**: Domain controller computer accounts are high-value targets. Implement strict security measures, including network isolation and restricted access, to protect them.

## Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent and descriptive naming conventions for computer accounts (e.g., based on location, department, or role) to simplify identification and management.
- **Organize with OUs**: Place computer accounts in dedicated OUs based on department, location, or function to streamline policy application and delegation of administration.
- **Limit Administrative Access**: Restrict the number of users with permission to manage computer accounts, especially for joining devices to the domain, to prevent unauthorized additions.
- **Monitor and Review**: Periodically review computer accounts to identify and disable accounts for decommissioned or unused devices, reducing potential attack vectors.
- **Apply GPOs Effectively**: Use GPOs to enforce security baselines on computer accounts, ensuring compliance with organizational standards for patch management, antivirus, and access controls.

## Conclusion

Active Directory Computers are critical for integrating devices into a domain, enabling secure authentication, centralized management, and policy enforcement. Proper organization, management, and security of computer accounts ensure that devices operate within the defined security framework of the AD environment. By adhering to best practices and maintaining vigilance over account activity, organizations can protect their network infrastructure while supporting operational efficiency.
