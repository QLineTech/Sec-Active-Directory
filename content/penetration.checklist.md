# Checklist: Coverage of Active Directory Penetration Testing Document

## Overview
This checklist confirms that the five-part presentation series comprehensively covers all content from the document *"Active Directory Penetration Testing: A Comprehensive Analysis"*. Each section of the original document is mapped to the corresponding part(s) in the series, ensuring no key points are missed.

| Document Section | Key Content | Covered in Part(s) | Checklist Items |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **1. Executive Summary** | AD’s critical role, pentesting importance, common attack vectors (Kerberos, NTLM, GPOs, integrated services), need for robust defenses. | Part 1, Part 5 | - [x] AD as high-value target<br>- [x] Pentesting objectives<br>- [x] Key vulnerabilities overview<br>- [x] Defense emphasis |
