### Part 1: Introduction to Active Directory Deception



# Introduction to Active Directory Deception

## Executive Summary
- **Active Directory (AD)**: Powers over 90% of enterprises, making it a critical yet vulnerable "golden key" to network access.
- **Deception Technology**: Employs honeypots, honey users, and honey credentials to detect internal threats proactively.
- **Key Benefits**: Delivers high-fidelity alerts, actionable threat intelligence, and reduced attacker dwell time.
- **Core Techniques**: Includes honeypot accounts, deceptive credentials, ADCS honeypots, and network-level decoys.

## What is Deception Technology?
- **Honeypots**: Decoy systems designed to lure and trap attackers for detection and analysis.
- **Deception**: A broader strategy integrating honey users, credentials, and other fake assets.
- **Interaction Levels**:
  - **Low-Interaction**: Basic service simulation for simple detection.
  - **High-Interaction**: Full system emulation for detailed insights.

| Type                | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Low-Interaction     | Simulates basic services; easy to deploy.        |
| High-Interaction    | Simulates full systems; resource-intensive.      |

## Why AD is a Target
- **Centralized Control**: Grants access to entire networks, a prime target for attackers.
- **Attack Tools**: BloodHound, Mimikatz, PowerView exploit AD vulnerabilities.
- **Detection Challenges**: Stealthy attacks bypass traditional security measures.

## Benefits of AD Deception
- **Early Detection**: High-confidence alerts with minimal false positives.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Reveals attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Reduced Dwell Time**: Speeds up threat response, limiting damage.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Focuses efforts on real threats, reducing alert fatigue.

### Part 2: Core Active Directory Deception Techniques



# Core Active Directory Deception Techniques

## Overview
- **Honey Users**: Fake accounts to catch brute-force and lateral movement.
- **Honey Credentials**: Deceptive data to detect credential theft.
- **ADCS Honeypots**: Traps targeting AD Certificate Services exploitation.
- **Network-Level Honeypots**: Decoys mimicking AD-related services.

## Honey Users
- **Purpose**: Detects unauthorized access attempts like password guessing.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use realistic names (e.g., "PatchAdmin").
  - Assign complex passwords and believable attributes.
  - Repurpose aged accounts for authenticity.

## Honey Credentials
- **Purpose**: Identifies credential theft attempts (e.g., via Mimikatz).
- **Types**:
  - Files (e.g., "passwords.txt").
  - Database entries, API keys, or cached credentials.
- **Placement**: LSASS memory, config files, or code repositories.

## ADCS Honeypots
- **Purpose**: Captures attempts to exploit AD Certificate Services.
- **Tool**: Certiception creates "vulnerable" yet safe templates.
- **Features**: Logs interactions, prevents real exploitation.

## Network-Level Honeypots
- **Purpose**: Detects reconnaissance and lateral movement.
- **Examples**: RDP, SMB, SSH decoys.
- **Tools**: ad-honeypot-autodeploy, Cowrie, Dionaea.

### Part 4: Challenges and Mitigation Strategies



# Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

## Challenges
- **Realism**: Decoys must blend in to fool attackers.
- **Resource Overhead**: High-interaction setups are demanding.
- **Legal/Ethical**: Privacy and entrapment risks.
- **False Negatives**: Attackers may evade detection.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Dynamic Realism**: Regularly update decoys.
- **Automation**: Simplify management and scaling.
- **Isolation**: Protect production systems.
- **Diversity**: Use varied decoy types.
