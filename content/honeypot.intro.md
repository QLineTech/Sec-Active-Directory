# Introduction to Active Directory Deception

## Executive Summary
- **Active Directory (AD)**: Powers over 90% of enterprises, making it a critical yet vulnerable "golden key" to network access.
- **Deception Technology**: Employs honeypots, honey users, and honey credentials to detect internal threats proactively.
- **Key Benefits**: Delivers high-fidelity alerts, actionable threat intelligence, and reduced attacker dwell time.
- **Core Techniques**: Includes honeypot accounts, deceptive credentials, ADCS honeypots, and network-level decoys.

## What is Deception Technology?
- **Honeypots**: Decoy systems designed to lure and trap attackers for detection and analysis.
- **Deception**: A broader strategy integrating honey users, credentials, and other fake assets.
- **Interaction Levels**:
  - **Low-Interaction**: Basic service simulation for simple detection.
  - **High-Interaction**: Full system emulation for detailed insights.

| Type                | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Low-Interaction     | Simulates basic services; easy to deploy.        |
| High-Interaction    | Simulates full systems; resource-intensive.      |

## Why AD is a Target
- **Centralized Control**: Grants access to entire networks, a prime target for attackers.
- **Attack Tools**: BloodHound, Mimikatz, PowerView exploit AD vulnerabilities.
- **Detection Challenges**: Stealthy attacks bypass traditional security measures.

## Benefits of AD Deception
- **Early Detection**: High-confidence alerts with minimal false positives.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Reveals attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Reduced Dwell Time**: Speeds up threat response, limiting damage.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Focuses efforts on real threats, reducing alert fatigue.
