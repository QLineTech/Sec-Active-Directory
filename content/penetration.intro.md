# Introduction to Active Directory Penetration Testing

## Executive Summary
- **Active Directory (AD)**: Identity and access management backbone for over 90% of organizations.
- **High-Value Target**: Compromise can lead to domain takeover and data exfiltration.
- **AD Pentesting**: Simulates real attacks to identify vulnerabilities proactively.
- **Key Findings**: Common attack vectors include authentication weaknesses, misconfigurations, and integrated service vulnerabilities.
- **Takeaway**: Continuous pentesting and strong defenses are critical.

## What is AD Pentesting?
- **Definition**: Controlled simulation of cyberattacks on AD to find exploitable weaknesses.
- **Objectives**:
  - Identify security gaps (misconfigs, weak policies, flaws).
  - Demonstrate real-world impact.
  - Provide actionable remediation steps.

## Why AD is a Prime Target
- **Centralized Control**: Manages all resources; one breach affects everything.
- **Complexity & Legacy**: Prone to misconfigs and outdated protocols.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Complex permissions enable low-to-high privilege jumps.
- **Service Integration**: Links to Exchange, SQL, etc., expand the attack surface.

| Reason                | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Centralized Control   | Single point of failure impacts entire network.  |
| Complexity & Legacy   | Misconfigs and old systems create risks.         |
| Privilege Escalation  | Permission flaws allow escalation.               |
| Service Integration   | Integrated apps can be exploited to hit AD.      |
